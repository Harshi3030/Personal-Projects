# Projects

## Auto grader (Learning mangement system project) 
- Project report done as part of internship
- Created a learning management system that allowed Talentsprint instructors to grade code submissions of students by running them against test cases. 
- Implemented using python in Django framework. Used Celery for queueing and Docker to create a sandbox environment for testing the code. 
- This system is still in use by the company and reducing approximately 10 hours per week manual effort involved in correcting code of students

## Machine learning 

### Classifying movie revirews
- Implemented different algorithms from scratch without using any library functions (Simple perceptron, Average perceptron, SVM, SVM with bagging, ID3, Naive Bayes, Random Forests) to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative.
- Achieved 87.504% on test data set and 92.8159% on train dataset.

### Apparel Recomendation engine
- Created a recommendation engine whose data set was collected from the Amazon API, which is used to suggest products based on other products selected by a customer.
- Used TF-IDF weighted word2vec for the title of the product, weighted similarity for other features as the brand, color, product type and VGG16 for image-based similarities.

## Natural Language processing 

### Question answering system.
- Built a question answering (Q/A) system that can process a story and a list of questions, to produce an answer for each question. 
- Used an ensemble of various techniques like TF-IDF, Bag of words, N-grams, multiple similarity measures, NER based scores and ideas from QUARC rule-based system.
